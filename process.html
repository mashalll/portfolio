            <h2>My Rationale</h2>
          <div class="grid-container3">
            <div class="grid-item3" style="background-color: #80799B;"></div>
            <div class="grid-item3" style="background-color: #333333"></div>
            <div class="grid-item3" style="background-color: rgba(113, 160, 176, 1);"></div>

            I chose the colours of lilac, light blue, dark grey, and white for my website's colour palette. Lilac and light blue are soft and calming colors that can help create a welcoming and approachable atmosphere on a website. Dark grey is a neutral color that can help create a modern and sophisticated look, and white is a clean and crisp color that can help create a sense of openness and clarity. These colors can also work well together to create a cohesive and harmonious color scheme for a website. Additionally, these colors are often considered easy to read on screen and can help create a user-friendly and accessible website.

            I used grids and wide margins to create a good website layout as they provide a structured and organized framework for the content. Wide margins good website layout by providing a structured and organized framework for the content. Grids allowed me to structure different types of elements, such as texts, images, and buttons. Different heading sizes and font weight also helped in providing a sense of hierarchy across elements.

          <h2>Wireframes</h2>
          <p style = "width:70%; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">I used the wireframes from my Wikipedia redesign to create the page layouts of this website. Instead of a large header image, I used a gradient with my main colours. In the highlights page where I use a gallery layout for my essays, I used the photo gallery wireframe by inserting screenshots of my essays and the topic and link underneath</p>
          <div class="grid-container3">
            <div class="grid-item3" ><img src="wf1.png" alt="Wikipedia article wireframe" style="width:500px;"></div>
            <div class="grid-item3" ><img src="wf2.png" alt="Wikipedia gallery wireframe" style="width:500px;"></div>
          </div>

          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p style = "width:70%; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto;">To ensure this website met the standards of WCAG 2.0 Accessibility, I added alterntive text to all the images. Buttons have descriptive values on them and form inputs have associated text labels. The reading and navigation order is logical and intuitive. All my text was considered large text as my paragraphs were 20px, so the colour contrast ratio (mostly grey text on white, or white text on purple) made the requirement. The navigation was accessible as each page was appropriately titled and the purpose of each link could be determined from the link text. </p>
